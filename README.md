# architecture_enforced_disentanglement

Investigate three architectures to enforce disentanglement on Darcy flow problem.
- Architecture changes may vary with each commit. In each commit, models added will correspond to the model architecture in that particular commit
- General architectures are illustrated, but specifics in architecture may vary with each commit. 
- Trained models are too large to push and stored locally, but post-processing figures are illustrated.

# Architecture 1 (arch1)
