# architecture_enforced_disentanglement

Investigate three architectures to enforce disentanglement on Darcy flow problem.
- Architecture changes may vary with each commit. In each commit, models added will correspond to the model architecture in that particular commit
- General architectures are illustrated, but specifics in architecture may vary with each commit. 
- Trained models are too large to push and stored locally, but post-processing figures are illustrated.

- Model figures are stored according to the following directory structure:
`problem/generative_parameter_dimension/generative_parameter_distribution/general_network_architecture/latent_dim/VAE_<trial_num>`
